Install the appliaction on any android device with min OS verison 4.0.

Make sure internet connection is there else a Toast message would be displayed.The first laucher activity simply contains a button and click of that would load all transactions 
for set of credentials as specified in LevelMoney docs.

On this activity there is one switch you can turn on/off if you want to ignore or include donuts related expenses in your spending.
This toggling would upadte the result in text view. By default switch is off means ignore-donuts is false.
